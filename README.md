UK Map D3 Visualization
This HTML code creates an interactive map of the United Kingdom using D3.js, where the size of town markers corresponds to their population. The webpage features a gradient background, a title, and a slider to adjust the number of displayed towns. Towns are represented as circles, dynamically changing in size based on the population, enabling users to visually compare population differences. The map initially renders with default data, and the "Reload Data" button allows users to update it. The code fetches map and town data from external sources, utilizing D3.js for dynamic rendering and interactive elements.

Getting Started
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd UK-Map-D3-Visualization


Open the index.html file in a web browser to see the visualization.

External Data Sources
The application fetches map data and population information from external APIs/sources (specify the sources if necessary).

How to Use
Adjust the Population Slider to display towns within a specific population range.
Click on the Reload Data button to fetch the latest data and update the map accordingly.
